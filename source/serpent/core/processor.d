/**
 * The virtual base class for any Processor (System) within the Serpent
 * core framework loop.
 *
 * Any implementation of Processor must explicitly extend with their
 * data-policy defined at compile time, i.e. ReadWrite or ReadOnly.
 *
 * A Processor can only be added to a group with the same data policy,
 * to allow optimisation of parallel execution strategies. Thus you
 * cannot add a ReadWrite Processor to a ReadOnly Group.
 *
 * With these (deliberate) limitations in mind, you should ensure
 * your group setup is chained to take advantage of this in terms
