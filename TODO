- Fix use of begin() to be private. Only Context should call this
- Cleanup demo to use deferred APIs only
- Fix segfaults in release build, likely too many inlines.
- Mark nearly *all* EntityManager methods as package access. We want
  to discourage all use of this and promote View API access.
- Fix TransformComponent problems (Potentially want a Transform2D + Transform3D)
- Consider removing all immediate APIs
- Require componentregistration before running the game?
- Add an Animation Timeline concept

    - components cannot contain slices to textures.
    - textures should be handles anyway.
    - an Animation should likely be a handle which returns the correct
      texture handle for a Timeline.
    - Then we can have multithreaded lightweight SpriteAnimation.

- Sprite batch performance:
    - Use instancing where possible (OpenGL 3.1+)
    - Use existing implementation when instancing unavailable
