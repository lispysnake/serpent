- Fix use of begin() to be private. Only Context should call this
- Cleanup demo to use deferred APIs only
- Massively improve performance of Renderer/FramePacket APIs.
  Should likely remove the copy steps for simple 2D types and just
  blit all visibles straight to the quadbatch and cut out the middleman.
- Fix segfaults in release build, likely too many inlines.
- Mark nearly *all* EntityManager methods as package access. We want
  to discourage all use of this and promote View API access.
- Fix TransformComponent problems (Potentially want a Transform2D + Transform3D)
